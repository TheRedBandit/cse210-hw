* Data structure
* It matches an object or thing in the real world
* Has properties (attributes, fields, member variables) which describe it or belong to it
* Has functions (methods, subroutines) which do things, usually with its properties
* An implementation of a class. Classes do not achieve anything until they are converted into an object in code

Classes
* A blueprint of an object
* Has properties (attributes, fields, member variables) which describe it or belong to it
* Has functions (methods, subroutines) which do things, usually with its properties
